vsbuffalo Any #rstats folks use handheld GPS data in R? Is there a model that's more friendly to getting data off?
ramhiser RT @dnusinow: Thinking about #ggplot2 in terms of a grammar is critical to avoid frustration. qplot is like baby talk and you need to outgrow it. #rstats
HarlanH Drinking lots of #coffee to recover from #Rstats hacking until midnight with @drewconway, @mikedewar and @johnmyleswhite. Getting old...!
drewconway Great night of hardcore #rstats hacking of WL data over @bitly with @mikedewar @johnmyleswhite @HarlanH, soon @hmason will be an R hack too!

jeffreybreen @jksloan @cdhowe is a braver man than I -- he's installing RApache despite the whole FORTRAN thing. #rstats
CMastication @JeffreyBreen is there a VM available with RApache pre installed? #rstats

joy_lee86 For me, much easier 2 learn from worked examples; online help gives me list of obscure options.  So, barely use R in a Nutshell #rstats
mariawolters @Rarchive I've noticed that a few of my #rstats related tweets have been reappearing - automatic copy by bots? Worth sanity-checking feed?
vicki_lu88 What I don't like about R in a Nutshell: often just replicates lists of arguments without examples or explanation. #rstats
neilkod @DataJunkie would it help to pare back the data outside of #rstats prior?

Anachronistic   Godawful traffic conspired to keep me from my Ruby meetup. I'm pretty bummed, actually.
